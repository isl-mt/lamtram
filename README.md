If you have any trouble in install or usage of lamtram, please contact the 
[lamtram-users group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lamtram-users) or file 
an issue on the [github page](http://github.com/neubig/lamtram). In addition to the
usage info below, you can also take a look at the [nmt-tips tutorial](http://github.com/neubig/nmt-tips)
on building strong neural machine translation systems.

Install/Citation
----------------

First, in terms of standard libraries, you must have autotools, libtool, and Boost. If
you are on Ubuntu/Debian linux, you can install them below:

    $ sudo apt-get install autotools libtool libboost-all

You must install Eigen and DyNet separately. Follow the directions on the
[dynet page](http://github.com/clab/dynet), which also explain about installing Eigen.
Note that in order to run programs like lamtram that are linked to DyNet, you will have
to set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable to include the DyNet library. For example, if
`$DYNET_DIR` is the top directory for DyNet, then you can run the following command,
or add it to you `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

    $ export LD_LIBARY_PATH="$DYNET_DIR/build/dynet:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

Once these two packages are installed and DyNet has been added to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`,
run the following commands, specifying the correct paths for dynet and Eigen.

    $ autoreconf -i
    $ ./configure --with-dynet=/path/to/dynet --with-eigen=/path/to/eigen
    $ make

In the instructions below, you can see how to use lamtram to train and use language
models, translation models, or text classifiers.

Language Models
---------------

### Training ###

To train a language model, you should prepare a training data set train.txt and
a development data set dev.txt. Before running training, you should decide a
vocabulary that you want to use, and replace all words outside of the vocabulary
with the symbol '<unk>'. The easiest way to do this is with the `script/unk-single.pl`
script.

    $ script/unk-single.pl < train.txt > train.unk

Then, we can perform training with `lamtram-train`. Here is a typical way to run it
with options:

    $ src/lamtram/lamtram-train \
        --dynet_mem 1024 \        # Allocate 1024 megabytes of memory for training
        --model_type nlm \        # Train a neural language model
        --layer_size 512 \        # Use a layer size of 512 for hidden layers, embeddings, etc.
        --trainer adam \          # Use adam for training models
        --learning_rate 0.001 \   # Set learning rate to 0.001
        --seed 0 \                # A random seed, or 0 for a different seed every run
        --train_trg train.unk \   # Specify the training file
        --dev_trg dev.txt \       # Specify the development file
        --model_out langmodel.out

Training will take a long time (at least until the "speed improvements" below are
finished), so try it out on a small data set first. As soon as one iteration
finishes, the model will be written out, so you can use the model right away.

### Evaluating Perplexity ###

You can measure perplexity on a separate test set `test.txt`

    $ src/lamtram/lamtram --dynet_mem 1024 --operation ppl --models_in nlm=langmodel.out < test.txt

### Generating Sentences ###

Once you have a model, you can try randomly generating sentences from the model:

    $ src/lamtram/lamtram --dynet_mem 1024 --sents 100 --operation gen --models_in nlm=langmodel.out

(Note: this may not work right now as of 2015-4-11. It will just generate the single
most likely sentence over and over again. This will be fixed soon.)

Translation Models
------------------

### Training ###

Training a translation model is similar to language models. Prepare a parallel corpus
consisting of train-src.txt and train-trg.txt (in the source and target languages), and
dev-src.txt and dev-trg.txt. First make '<unk>' symbols like before.

    $ script/unk-single.pl < train-src.txt > train-src.unk
    $ script/unk-single.pl < train-trg.txt > train-trg.unk

Then, we can perform training with `lamtram-train`. Here is a typical way to run it to train
an attentional model similar to Bahdanau et al. (ICLR2015). You can also train an LSTM encoder-decoder
model as in Sutskever et. al (NIPS2014) by just changing "encatt" into "encdec."

    $ src/lamtram/lamtram-train \
        --dynet_mem 1024 \        # Allocate 1024 megabytes of memory for training
        --model_type encatt \     # Create an atttentional model
        --layer_size 512 \        # Use a layer size of 512 for hidden layers, embeddings, etc.
        --trainer adam \          # Use adam for training models
        --learning_rate 0.001 \   # Set learning rate to 0.001
        --seed 0 \                # A random seed, or 0 for a different seed every run
        --train_src train-src.unk \ # Specify the training source file
        --train_trg train-trg.unk \ # Specify the training target file
        --dev_src dev-src.txt  \  # Specify the development source file
        --dev_trg dev-trg.txt \   # Specify the development target file
        --model_out transmodel.out

Again, as soon as one iteration finishes, the model will be written out.
      
### Evaluating Perplexity ###

You can measure perplexity on a separate test set `test-src.txt` and `test-trg.txt`

    $ src/lamtram/lamtram \
        --dynet_mem 1024 \
        --operation ppl \
        --src_in test-src.txt \
        --models_in encdec=transmodel.out \
        < test-trg.txt

If you used the same data is before, the perplexity of the translation model should
be significantly lower than that of the language model, as the translation model has
the extra information from the input sentence.

### Decoding ###

You can also generate the most likely translation for the input sentence. Here is a typical
use case.

    $ src/lamtram/lamtram \
        --dynet_mem 1024 \
        --operation ppl \
        --operation gen \
        --src_in test-src.txt \
        --models_in encdec=transmodel.out \
        --beam 5 \        # Perform beam search with a beam of 5
        --word_pen 0.0 \  # The word penalty can be used to increase or decrease
                          # the average length of the sentence (positive for more words)
        > results.txt

You can also use model ensembles. Model ensembles allow you to combine two different models
with different initializations or structures. Using model ensembles is as simple as listing
multiple models separated by a pipe.

    --models_in "encdec=transmodel.out|nlm=langmodel.out"

Note however that the models must have the same vocabulary (i.e. be trained on the same data).
Ensembles will work for both generation and perplexity measurement.

Classifiers
-----------

### Training ###

Training a text classifier is very similar to translation models. The only difference is that
you want to create a file of the text you want to classify train-src.txt, and a correct label 
file with one label per line, train-lbl.txt. This is not absolutely necessary, but you can
convert rare words in the source into unknown symbols like before:

    $ script/unk-single.pl < train-src.txt > train-src.unk

Then, we can perform training with `lamtram-train`. Here is a typical way to run it to train
an LSTM model.

    $ src/lamtram/lamtram-train \
        --dynet_mem 1024 \        # Allocate 1024 megabytes of memory for training
        --model_type enccls \     # Create an encoder-classifier model
        --layer_size 512 \        # Use a layer size of 512 for hidden layers, embeddings, etc.
        --trainer adam \          # Use adam for training models
        --learning_rate 0.001 \   # Set learning rate to 0.001
        --seed 0 \                # A random seed, or 0 for a different seed every run
        --train_src train-src.unk \ # Specify the training source file
        --train_trg train-lbl.txt \ # Specify the training label file
        --dev_src dev-src.txt \   # Specify the development source file
        --dev_trg dev-lbl.txt \   # Specify the development label file
        --model_out clsmodel.out

Again, as soon as one iteration finishes, the model will be written out.
      
### Evaluating Perplexity/Accuracy ###

You can measure perplexity and classification accuracy on a separate test set `test-src.txt`
and `test-lbl.txt`

    $ src/lamtram/lamtram \
        --dynet_mem 1024 \
        --operation clseval \
        --src_in test-src.txt \
        --models_in enccls=clsmodel.out \
        < test-lbl.txt

### Classifying ###

You can also generate the most likely label for the input sentence. Here is a typical use case.

    $ src/lamtram/lamtram \
        --dynet_mem 1024 \
        --operation cls \
        --models_in enccls=clsmodel.out \
        > results.txt

You can also use model ensembles as with the translation models.

    --models_in "enccls=clsmodel1.out|enccls=clsmodel2.out"

Note however that the models must have the same vocabulary (i.e. be trained on the same data).
Ensembles will work for both perplexity measurement and classification.
